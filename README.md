This repo is to help track my experiments with Linux Preempt-RT (Real-Time) and Open Powerlink. The kernel used is the Linux Kernel 5.4.19 which is available publicly while the real-time patch that I am using is patch-5.4.44-rt27.patch.xz. I had to change from  patch-5.4.44-rt27.patch.xz to patch-5.4.44-rt10.patch.xz in order to build successfully.
